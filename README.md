## Tutorial Instructions Preview

These are **previews** of tutorials, meaning that the complete instructions for the exercises in the previews aren't present. The complete instructions will be typically available early (4 AM?) morning on the day of the tutorial.

I **do** provide some suggestions for things you can do to get a head-start on some exercises.
