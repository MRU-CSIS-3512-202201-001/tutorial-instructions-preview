# Tutorial 04: DOM Manipulation

**2022-01-31 (M)**

---

## Overview

This tutorial is meant to get you used to futzing with the DOM: selecting things, altering text, playing with styles, adding elements, and removing them. Roll up your sleeves and gird your loins, not necessarily in that order. 

## Getting a Head Start

Take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202201-001/tut-04-html) and read that README.


## Instructions
   
1. Go to the [GitHub Classroom Links section of the tutorials document](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202201-001/shared-course-material/blob/main/tutorials.md#github-classroom-links) in our GitHub Org.
   
2. Click on the correct link to accept the "assignment". 

    _Links won't be active until early (like 4 AM?) on Monday mornings._

3. Clone the accepted repository to your computer.
   
4. Open the resulting local repository in VS Code.

5. Run `npm install` in the VS Code terminal to install the tools used by the plumbing.
   
6. Work through the exercises in any order you prefer. Use the appropriate exercise section below to guide you.
   
7. When you feel you are ready for JP to look at your work, DM him on Discord and be prepared to share your screen when he is ready.

## How Things Look at the Start of Each Exercise

The same page, `index.html` is used for each exercise. It looks like this in the browser:

![before](images/before.png)

Your job for each exercise will be to **change how the page looks using only JavaScript - you're not allowed to touch the html or its embedded style sheet at all**. 

Fun!
